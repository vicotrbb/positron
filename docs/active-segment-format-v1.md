# Active Segment and Durability Frontier Format v3

This document is the Release 1 byte-level authority for the files written by
the Storage Kernel Active Segment Ledger. The Catalog publishes segment
lifecycle metadata; these files carry canonical Signal Store blocks and their
authenticated local durability bound.

All integers are unsigned big-endian. Readers reject unknown versions,
trailing frontier bytes, invalid tags, impossible positions, duplicate active
metadata, symlinks, hard links, and non-regular files.

## Paths and identity

Each segment has a random nonzero 128-bit `segment_id`. Files are rooted below
the owned Primary Data Volume and opened relative to retained directories:

- `segments/active/<segment_id hex>.segment`
- `segments/active/<segment_id hex>.frontier`
- `segments/sealed/<segment_id hex>.segment`
- `segments/sealed/<segment_id hex>.frontier`

The immutable physical scope is `(tenant_id, signal_kind, virtual_shard_id)`.
One Catalog object records the scope, segment identity, lifecycle state, and
base Commit Position. At most one object per scope may be active. Catalog
Generations are the lifecycle authority; the encrypted physical header records
segment creation and is not rewritten while sealing or reclaiming.

## Catalog segment metadata

| Bytes | Field | Value or limit |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 8 | magic | ASCII `PSEGMET1` |
| 2 | version | `1` |
| 1 | state | `1` active, `2` sealed, `3` retired |
| 16 | tenant ID | nonzero domain identity |
| 1 | signal | `1` logs, `2` traces |
| 4 | virtual shard ID | valid nonzero shard |
| 16 | segment ID | random, nonzero |
| 8 | base Commit Position | predecessor frontier; for `retired`, the segment's final frontier |

The encoding is exactly 56 bytes. Objects without this magic belong to another
Catalog authority and are ignored. Matching magic with invalid length,
version, or fields fails closed.

## Catalog retention frontier

Each retention-enabled physical scope has at most one authenticated frontier
object in the same Catalog Generation as its segment metadata:

| Bytes | Field | Value or limit |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 8 | magic | ASCII `PRETFR01` |
| 2 | version | `1` |
| 16 | tenant ID | nonzero domain identity |
| 1 | signal | `1` logs, `2` traces |
| 4 | virtual shard ID | valid nonzero shard |
| 8 | frontier Ingest Time | signed Unix nanoseconds |

The encoding is exactly 39 bytes. A matching magic with an unknown version,
invalid length, invalid scope, or duplicate scope fails closed. The initial
value comes from the kernel retention-time authority before the scope contains
retention-enabled data. Thereafter it advances only by process-monotonic
elapsed time. Recovery resumes at the authenticated durable value and adds no
downtime; subsequent wall-clock movement cannot advance or regress it.

Block preparation publishes this frontier before issuing the move-only
preparation capability. Retirement publishes its advanced frontier and all
Retired segment metadata in one Catalog Writer transaction. An ambiguous
publication is reconciled against the latest authenticated generation; live
snapshot visibility follows that latest generation before an ordinary failure
is returned. Legacy segments without both a v3 durability bound and this
frontier remain retention-ineligible.

## Segment header

Format v3 replaces the rejected route-unbound draft v2 bootstrap. The segment
starts with only the fields needed to select the format and recover the DEK:

| Bytes | Field | Value or limit |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 8 | magic | ASCII `PSEGACT3` |
| 2 | version | `2` |
| 2 | frame algorithm | `1`, AES-256-GCM |
| 2 | wrapping algorithm | `1`, AES-256-KWP |
| 2 | provider family | `1`, local/provider-neutral Release 1 route |
| 16 | provider key reference | opaque, nonzero |
| 8 | provider key epoch | nonzero |
| 4 | wrapped-key length | `1..=256` |
| variable | wrapped segment DEK | authenticated AES-KWP envelope |
| 4 | encrypted-metadata-frame length | `1..=256` |
| variable | encrypted segment metadata | AES-256-GCM frame over the exact 56-byte Catalog encoding above |

Each physical segment receives a fresh 256-bit data-encryption key. The
caller-provided protection key wraps that DEK; it is not used for frame
encryption. The opaque provider reference and epoch must match the supplied
recovery capability before unwrap. Provider family, reference, and epoch are
also embedded in the canonical wrapped payload and its context digest. The
wrapped-key context binds the Positron instance, key kind, segment object and
key epoch, segment scope, tenant, signal, shard, format epoch, and exact provider
route. The encrypted metadata independently binds scope, segment identity,
creation lifecycle, and the segment's creation base Commit Position. Retention
does not rewrite this physical metadata; a retired Catalog continuity marker
is the logical retirement record after the file leaves the active snapshot set.
A wrong protection key,
substituted route, or substituted context fails authentication.

The header is written once, synchronized, then made reachable by synchronizing
the active directory. A partial header is never usable.

## Store Block records

Immediately after the header, each canonical Store Block is encoded as:

| Bytes | Field | Value or limit |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 4 | encrypted-frame length | at most 1,048,960 |
| variable | encrypted frame | existing encrypted-frame format; plaintext is the 16-byte stable Store Block identity, one-byte retention tag, signed 64-bit exact kernel preparation Ingest Time, then canonical block bytes |

Plaintext blocks are nonempty and at most 1,048,576 bytes. Frame context binds
the segment object, `StoreBlock` purpose, format and key epochs, and the
one-based frame sequence reserved after metadata sequence zero. Commit Position
is `base_position + frame_sequence`. This sole ledger
authority owns allocation. Recovery never appends to the predecessor: it seals
it and creates a fresh successor with a fresh DEK, preventing nonce reuse.

Retrying the same stable Store Block identity with the same canonical bytes is
idempotent within the retained ledger. Reusing an identity with different
bytes fails closed. Equal canonical bytes under distinct identities are
legitimate separate appends.

The per-block retention tag is `1` with a zero time when authenticated
lifecycle metadata is unavailable, or `2` with the exact kernel-issued
preparation Ingest Time. Empty (`0`) is invalid for a Store Block. Recovery
authenticates every block value and folds them to the segment maximum; the
result must exactly match the authenticated Durability Frontier aggregate.

## Durability Frontier

Format v3 writes frontier envelope version 1, carries the active-segment format
version explicitly, and encrypts the metadata as one independent frame:

| Bytes | Field | Value or limit |
| ---: | --- | --- |
| 8 | magic | ASCII `PFRONT02` |
| 2 | frontier envelope version | `1` |
| 2 | active-segment format version | `3` |
| 4 | encrypted-frame length | at most 512 |
| variable | encrypted frontier frame | v3 plaintext is `active_segment_format_version:u16 || durable_bytes:u64 || next_sequence:u64 || commit_position:u64 || retention_tag:u8 || maximum_ingest_time:i64` |

The authenticated inner `active_segment_format_version` must equal the outer
selector before recovery interprets any v3 block or retention field. Changing
only the outer selector between v3 and a legacy layout is integrity corruption.
`retention_tag` is `0` for an empty segment, `1` when complete lifecycle
metadata is unavailable, and `2` when `maximum_ingest_time` is the authenticated
aggregate of every Store Block appended to the segment. Non-Log Store and
legacy frontier-v1 segments recover as unavailable and cannot be selected for
destructive retention. Frontier format v1 has no retention bound. Frontier
format v2 remains readable, but its legacy caller-supplied bound is treated as
unavailable for destructive retention. Frontier format v3 is emitted only from
the Storage Kernel's move-only block preparation and is therefore the first
format whose maximum Ingest Time can authorize retention. The Log Store encodes
the kernel-issued Ingest Time while preparing canonical records; the Storage
Kernel preserves that exact value in the Store Block frame, authenticates the
aggregate in the frontier, and derives deletion evidence by folding those
values after restart.

The frontier frame purpose is `DurabilityFrontier`; its nonce sequence is
`u64::MAX - encrypted_next_sequence`, disjoint from metadata and Store Block
sequences. Recovery tries only the bounded Release 1 sequence
domain and requires the authenticated plaintext to agree with the successful
sequence. No segment identity, Commit Position, or sequence is plaintext in
the frontier artifact. Each historical receipt authenticator is an HMAC under
the segment object key over a domain separator plus that commit's authenticated
`durable_bytes`, sequence, and Commit Position. Recovery derives the same exact
per-block evidence; a later frontier never replaces an earlier receipt.

Before a new active segment becomes Catalog-reachable, creation durably
publishes an authenticated empty frontier with the header byte length,
sequence zero, and the segment base Commit Position. This provides a proven
truncation boundary for an interrupted first append.

Acknowledgment is permitted only after this order completes:

1. write the frame-length prefix, protect the frame, and complete its bytes;
2. synchronize the segment file;
3. write and synchronize a new temporary frontier;
4. rename it over the published frontier;
5. synchronize the frontier directory.

The receipt contains segment ID, Commit Position, and frontier authenticator.
The first successfully written length-prefix byte is the segment-mutation
boundary; protection occurs only after that boundary so a pre-write refusal
does not consume a nonce. Failure before mutation is retryable. Failure after
segment mutation, including segment metadata inspection and temporary-frontier
cleanup or creation, requires reopen. Failure after frontier rename but before directory synchronization is
commit-ambiguous: no receipt is returned and reopen determines whether the
authenticated frontier became reachable.

## Recovery

Recovery authenticates the frontier before verifying the bounded segment
prefix it names. Every record length, sequence-derived context, encrypted-frame
tag, and Commit Position must agree.

- Missing or truncated bytes at or before the frontier are corruption.
- A missing frontier with any payload bytes is ambiguous integrity and fences
  recovery without truncation. A legacy header-only segment remains readable
  as empty.
- Authentication failure, including wrong-key recovery, fails closed.
- Bytes after the frontier are unacknowledged and may be truncated only while
  the Catalog still names the segment active.
- Sealed segments must match their frontier exactly.
- A crash between segment and frontier renames is reconciled by locating and
  authenticating the files independently, then completing the seal.
- A crash after physical seal but before Catalog publication is reconciled
  from the predecessor Catalog Generation and atomically republished with its
  fresh active successor.

Recovery and append require Resource Governor reservations. Cancellation is
observed before admission; admitted durability work runs to a typed terminal
outcome. Any post-write append failure poisons the live ledger so no retry can
reuse an AEAD sequence before recovery creates a fresh segment and DEK.

Startup and offline integrity verification authenticate each active segment's
header and frontier to bound its durable byte traversal before checking the
byte budget. A budget too small for that prefix reports incomplete with the
segment omitted; a complete traversal accounts for its authenticated bytes.

## Migration policy

There is no released v1 data contract to migrate. Readers explicitly refuse
the old `PSEGACT1` plaintext-metadata and route-unbound `PSEGACT2` draft formats,
as well as the `PFRONT01` plaintext frontier, as unsupported;
they do not guess, partially import, or silently rewrite them. A future
released-format migration requires an accepted ADR and an explicit bounded
migration path.

## Sealing

Sealing moves the unchanged segment and frontier from `active` to `sealed`,
synchronizes both directories, and publishes sealed Catalog metadata. It does
not copy, decrypt, re-encrypt, or rewrite acknowledged bytes. Retention changes
sealed metadata to `retired` in one Catalog publication, recording its final
frontier in the retired metadata and making the segment
invisible to new snapshots. The retired files remain in `sealed` until no
existing snapshot or live Snapshot Lease references them; reclamation then
unlinks the files and retains a bounded retired Catalog continuity marker so
the next active segment can be reopened without reintroducing expired data.
Every rename and publication edge is idempotently recoverable.

## Bounds

- Store Block plaintext: 1,048,576 bytes.
- Encrypted frame: 1,048,960 bytes.
- Wrapped DEK: 256 bytes.
- Recovered blocks: 1,024, with at most 1,048,576 retained plaintext bytes.
- Catalog segment metadata inherits the Catalog's 1,024-object bound.
- Recovery memory and descriptor claims are explicit Resource Governor inputs;
  there is no unbounded scan or hidden retry loop.
